\f0\fs24 \cf0 DanceOff is a simple dance competition game/simulator created by Budnampet Ramanudom and Tina Xu in during the 2014/2015 academic year. The game was originally intended to be a final project for an Python based introductory CS course at Wellesley College. Because of this, we decided to integrate our professors\'92 heads into game just for some kicks and giggles. \
\
In order to play the game, please run DanceOff.py. Then, please select a head and a dance move for the for each player (left and right). When you\'92re ready to see the hilarity unfold press start! }
